### `purpose`
this web application is for both _admins_ and _users_.
It's categorized into three parts: stocks, interns and complaints.
The _admins_ have access to modify, add and receive requests which they have the authority to accept or refuse in all three parts of the app.
The _users_ on the other hand are treated seperatly, stocks are for only employees to search and make requests to get the inventory needed. 
Students have the right to fill out the form to intern inside the hospital.
And finally anyone can make complaints and comments if any inconvinience arises.
=> The response of the _admins_ comes in the form of an email sent directly from the website, either automatically or manually

### `technologies used`
ReactJS (frontend and routing)
Firebase (database and backend)
emailJS (handling email responses from _admins_)
